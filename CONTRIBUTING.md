## Project Philosophy (Please Read First)

Radix_Plus is:

- Fully open-source
- Free for individuals, researchers, students, and the community
- Publicly available with no hidden or restricted features

The goal of this project is **not** to take community work and sell it.
The goal is to keep the project open while allowing companies to support
its development through commercial licensing when needed.

## License Overview

Radix_Plus is released under the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**.

This means:

- Anyone can use the project for free
- Anyone can study, modify, and redistribute it
- Any public redistribution must follow GPL terms

The open-source version is the **complete project**, not a limited edition.

## Commercial Use (Companies Only)

Companies or enterprises may need a **commercial license** in cases such as:

- Using Radix_Plus inside proprietary or closed-source products
- Using Radix_Plus in paid SaaS platforms without GPL compliance
- Internal corporate usage where GPL obligations are legally incompatible

In these cases:

- The company pays for a commercial license
- The community version remains free and open
- No features are removed from the open-source project

Individuals and non-commercial users **do not need to pay**.
